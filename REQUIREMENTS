- run a program of choice (x) times where x is configurable
- then for each run
-- wait (n) seconds - where n is configurable (to allow for program start-up, library loading etc.)
-- record the addresses and sizes of the mapped memory pages noting which are writeable and writeable/executable
- at the conclusion of (x) executions scan through the results and see if any addresses are consistently writeable and writeable/executable at the same address (even if the sizes differ)
